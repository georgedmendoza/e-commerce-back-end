# e-commerce-back-end

## Description 
  This application manages the creation of an e-commerce backend using sequelize, MySQL2, and express.js. The express Api is configured so it can use sequelize to interact with the MySQL datase. The purpose of this application is to get,create,update, and/or delete data using Insomnia core. This allows the user to make adjustments to the database based on the endpoints provided in the code. A brief video is attached in the Usage section to see how the application functions when the user is interacting with it.
